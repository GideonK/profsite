  abstract = {The Afrikaans wordnet is a lexical-conceptual network in the form of an electronic lexical database, developed at the North-West University. In this article, a methodology for a semi-automatic construction of the entries - so-called synonym sets - is investigated. Firstly, a background is given on the nature of a wordnet, as well as "WordNet", on which it is based. Other wordnets, as well as applications of wordnets, are also discussed here. Next, the macrostructure of a wordnet in terms of its integration and compatibility with other wordnets is investigated, after which the proposed methodology is presented with a discussion of the results. Finally, a projection is made to the integration of the Afrikaans wordnet with other resources, which include "WordNet" and an Afrikaans lexical database, called ALEXANDER.},
